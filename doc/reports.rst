Reports
=======

Reports are a great way to document how a patch ROM is configured when it is in
storage or being shipped out.

Reports contain two sections: a map of circuit numbers to addresses (similar to
what is shown in the :doc:`editor`) and a visual representation of the rack with
each address shown in its place.

Reports can be generated in the :doc:`browser` by right-clicking on a ROM file
and choosing :guilabel:`Create Report` or in the :doc:`editor` from the Edit
menu.
